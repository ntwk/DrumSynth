This is the Drumsynth 2.0 Win32 app with it's DLL and help file
that get built by the projects in the other folders.

library.zip is a collection of .ds files to use with DrumSynth.
It should be unzipped so the individual folders of .ds files
are at the same level as drumsyn.exe so it can find them.
